This folder contains sample images from the zxing library and other images that I took to include in the PhraseMeme Scanner application.

All of the other files are used by the BarcodeSampleChooser.xaml page and should be stored in the parent project as content files in the xap.

These files should then be referenced by the SampleImages.xml file (also stored as a content file in the parent project) so that they can be accessed by the BarcodeSampleItemManager.cs class.
